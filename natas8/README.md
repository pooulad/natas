# natas8

Path traversal.

This page doesnâ€™t validate the input page, and therefore is vulnerable to path traversal attack.

Remember that the introduction of Natas Wargame says All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/ and named as /etc/natas_webpass/natasX. Thus, we can try to set the param page as /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 and find the password.

Note: Input /etc/natas_webpass/natas7 to find the password for this page itself. Other numbers would fail due to privilege limitation.
